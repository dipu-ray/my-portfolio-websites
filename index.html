                    <b>Hare Krishna</b>! I am Dipu Ray. I am a computer science student and also learning web development. I am now learning front end part of web development. It's almost the end now. I have already learned <b>HTML5, CSS3, JAVASCRIPT, BOOTSTRAP and RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN</b>. I am also doing several projects. Like - PORTFOLIO, CLONE WEBSITES etc. doing many other types of projects. Now when the front end part of the web development is over I will start the back end part. I have lived this as my career.

                    This time was the best for me. At that time I loved to play cricket. I used to play cricket all day. Home though
                    Had to listen to a lot of things. I didn't mind it. Then came the final exam of class five. At that time I was busy with exams and studies. After the exam, I entered high school. Due to busy schedule of exams, admissions and high school time, the interest towards cricket gradually decreased.

                <p>
                    Primary school life is over. I did not play cricket like before when I came to higher secondary school. I don't know why, I didn't want to play cricket like before, I was busy with studies. Then came the class 8 exam. Class 8 ended with exams and studies. The result came fairly. I bought arts because of not good results. I couldn't have as much fun in high school as in primary school.

                <p>
                    Class 9th and almost 10th passed. After that came the 10th class model test exam. Studying was not done like that. Because after reaching ninth grade, I started learning music. Music entered my life after cricket. Music was everything to me then. I used to learn music for about one and a half years. Then, as SSC was ahead, I dropped everything and started studying with all my heart.

                <p>
                    Then the SSC exam is over. I am thinking about what to do now, where to get admission. But since my childhood, I had a love for technology, like mobiles, laptops, tablets etc. Since my background was Arts, I came to Diploma to save this dream. I gave computer technology in all colleges while giving college choice. Finally the admission in Shariatpur Polytechnic is completed. Everything is going well now. Also learning web development.
